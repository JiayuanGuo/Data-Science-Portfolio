Background and Objective
------------------------

Electricity is a globally consumed energy source, such that electricity generation based on conventional energy sources (Petroleum, Coal, and Natrual Gas) are accompanied with large amount of greanhouse gas emission, particularly the carbon dioxide gas. Figure below mapped out the electricity generation plants with different type of energy sources within the United States in year 2015.

Electricity Analysis Suggestion Ensemble, or short for EASE, is a Proejct guided by the eScience Insititue and Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Washington. 

EASE is a suggestion model with an aim to help industrial users who desire to build an electricity generation plant that offsets long term cost from continuously buying electricity from the Government. User inputs weather information and plant capacity (average summer temperature, average winter temperature, annual precipitation, and average wind speed), EASE will automatically allocate energy information that can be utilized and provide suggestions on electricity generation sources.

Based on RandomForest classification model from scikit-learn, EASE considers weather, cost, carbon dioxide emission/taxation, and energy source distribution information. The output of the model is an optimized suggestion with most economical, best weather suitable, clean, and most efficient.

EASE cost prediction is largely based on 2015 average plant construction cost data, this includes but not limited to installation cost, maintenance cost,  operation cost, and electricity sale price. Carbon dioxide taxation is based on a 2013 proposed legislation (S. 332 of the 113th)

Package Usage
----------------------
**For Mac:**</p>
Step 1: Open the terminal, type </p>
    `$ python --version`</p>
If your Python version is `Python 3.5.0` or later, skip step 2 & 3.</p>
Step 2: Install Homebrew, type</p>
    `$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`</p>
For more information, visit [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).</p>
Step 3: Use Homebrew to install Python, type</p>
    `$ brew install python3`</p>
Once Python 3 is installed, weâ€™re going to check that is it ready to use or our system by launching the interactive console. Type</p>
    `$ python3`</p>
and you should see `Python 3.6.0`. Type</p>
    `>>> exit()`</p>
Step 4: Install dependencies, type</p>
    `$ brew tap homebrew/science`</p>
    `$ brew install matplotlib pandaseq`</p>
    `$ pip3 install numpy scipy scikit-learn`</p>
Step 5: Get our package, type</p>
    `$ git clone https://github.com/danielfather7/EASE-Project.git`</p>
Step 6: Change directory, type</p>
    `$ cd EASE-Project/GUI/`</p>
Step 7: Open our package, type</p>
    `$ python3 EASE_GUI.py`</p>
Enjoy!
